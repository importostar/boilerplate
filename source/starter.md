    """
    The solver works by first "creating" 
    the board from a list of tuples in the
    form (Column, Row, Value) with zero in 
    the value meaning the space is empty. 
    The board is contained within a dictionary
    called spaces that contains the name of the
    square in the form ColumnRow (e.g A1) with 
    the key being mapped to a value that's an 
    instance of the custom made class space,
    with the attributes row, column, value, name,
    impossible, and possible. The starter.py file
    also creates the areas the board will work with
    namely the columns, rows, and squares. 
    
    The game begins...
