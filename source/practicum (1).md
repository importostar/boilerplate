    # in the same directory as the `game.py` file we provided.

    def match(row):
        """
        Matches all identical elements in the row.
    
        This function searches for possible matches in a row ( a match is when
        two identical elements are next to each other or only separated from
        each other by `None`'s.).  When a match is found, the match is made and
        the result is placed on the position of the *left* most element in the match.
    
        The function also calculates the score for matching in this row.  The score for
        matching the elements in the row is the sum of all matched elements.  If,
        for example, the row has two 4 elements next to each other, the score will be
        8.  If the row has two 2 elements and two 4 elements next to each other
        (`[ 2, 2, 4, 4 ]`), the score will be 12.

        elements to introduce is given by `number`.  The location of the new elements
        should be chosen at random.
    
        To make the game more difficult, the elements introduced could also be greater
        than 2.  This is achieved through the `difficulty` argument.  Given a `difficulty` of
        `n`, this function should only introduce elements smaller or equal to math.pow( 2, n ).
        The power of 2 for the new elements can be chosen randomly from the range 1 to n,
