    # Qt.SplashScreen identifies ourselves as a splashscreen-type loading window, which sometimes are allowed to hang out on top.
    # Qt.FramelessWindowHint asks to be made free of all window chrome and decoration. No close buttons.
    # Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint asks to be allowed to stay on top of everything else.
    # Qt.WindowDoesNotAcceptFocus just says that we want all the attention to be somewhere else.

    ratetext.setGraphicsEffect(shadow) # And apply the effect.

    hbox.addWidget(ratetext) # Add the heart rate to the horizontal box.
    hbox.addStretch(1) # Add a stretcher that will suck up as much space as it can.
    hbox.addWidget(heart) # Add the heart icon to the horizonal box.
    #hbox.addStretch(1) # And another stretcher, make them fight each other. The point of this is to basically "center" the heart icon in the leftover space.
    
    vbox.addLayout(hbox) # Add that horizontal box to the vertical box.
    vbox.addWidget(line) # Add that fancy line thing to the vertical box.
    window.setLayout(vbox) # And set the vertical box as our main layout here.

    # And every time you update the GUI and need it to show, you just give it a little bit of this
